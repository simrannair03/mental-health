Prompt to Build AI-Powered Youth Mental Wellness Chatbot Application

Develop a confidential, empathetic, and scalable AI-powered chatbot designed specifically to support youth mental wellness. The chatbot must provide completely anonymous access without requiring personal identifiers, ensuring full privacy and reducing stigma associated with mental health discussions. Using advanced generative AI and natural language processing, the chatbot should offer personalized, evidence-based therapy techniques such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, dynamically adapting responses based on the user’s emotional state, preferences, and cultural context.

Include features that allow users to choose from diverse support personas (peer, mentor, therapist) to increase relatability and trust. Integrate guided self-help tools such as mood tracking, journaling prompts, breathing exercises, and psychoeducational content within the chat interface to empower ongoing mental wellness management. Implement robust crisis detection that can identify signs of distress or risk, triggering immediate referrals to trusted crisis resources or emergency support.

Ensure all communications are securely encrypted with transparent user controls for data privacy, including options for data deletion and notification settings. Design the platform to support continuous co-design with youth users to refine content, language, and interaction for inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. Develop the system modularly for easy scalability and integration with schools, community organizations, and existing teletherapy platforms.

Focus on delivering a user-friendly, engaging experience that normalizes help-seeking and reduces stigma through empathetic AI interactions and creative content generation (e.g., storybooks, interactive guides). The solution should be optimized for rapid prototyping and MVP development within a hackathon environment, with planned user feedback loops to enhance impact and effectiveness post-launch.
